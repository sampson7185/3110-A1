Used this line: waitpid(-1,&status,WNOHANG | WUNTRACED); composes less than 1% of my program
My program works for almost all the functions in section 1 & 2 except for background processes. It also doesn't properly close child processes if they are backgrounded. All other commands work except "grep if *.c", it says no such file. Piping and outputing/inputing from a file all works as expected. The program does not do anything from section 3.
